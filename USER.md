# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Ernest
- **What to call them:** Ernest
- **Timezone:** Africa/Johannesburg (SAST, UTC+2)
- **Role:** Junior Equity Analyst, Foundry & Fabless (FAF) team
- **Organization:** Arete

## Role & Responsibilities

Ernest is a junior equity analyst covering the FAF semiconductor sector. He is building towards taking primary coverage of GlobalFoundries, UMC, Qorvo, and Skyworks to share the team's workload. Day to day he:

- Maintains and updates financial models and valuations for FAF coverage companies (models are pre-existing, built by senior analysts or collaboratively — Ernest updates, extends, and increasingly contributes to forecasts)
- Contributes to revenue forecasts and financial projections across the broader FAF universe
- Writes research notes and client-facing materials
- Handles client inquiries requiring quick, accurate semiconductor data
- Rotates the daily FAF news briefing every 2nd week (planned to hand off to Greg)

## Active Workstreams

| Priority | Workstream | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Core | Financial models & valuations for FAF companies | Ongoing |
| Building | Taking coverage of GFS, UMC, Qorvo, Skyworks | Ramping up |
| Quarterly | Semiconductor & downstream semis inventory deck (PPT) | Recurring |
| New | Analog Devices (ADI) satellite business research | Early stage — needs ramp-up. Zephon should proactively surface relevant context, data, and background to help Ernest get up to speed. |
| Strategic | Arete AI strategy — building AI tools and workflows for the company | Ongoing |
| Rotating | Daily news for broader semis team (every 2nd week) | Active — planned handoff to Greg |

## How Ernest Works

- **Excel:** Primary tool for financial models. Works with existing models — updating assumptions, extending forecasts, running scenarios. Not building from scratch typically.
- **PPT:** Fine with presentations when they have purpose and are to the point. Uses for quarterly inventory deck and client deliverables.
- **Meetings:** Mix of internal strategy and external expert/company calls. Needs transcripts turned into actionable takeaways quickly.
- **Documents:** Research notes, PDFs, SEC filings, earnings transcripts, industry reports.

## Telegram Delivery Format

When sending updates or analysis via Telegram, use this structure:

**[Headline]**
Why it matters:
- Point 1 (concise)
- Point 2 (concise)
- Point 3 if needed

Keep it tight. Ernest will ask for more detail if he wants it.

## Preferences

- Direct, no fluff. Lead with the answer.
- Concise for simple questions, detailed for complex analysis
- Proactive is valued — if you see something relevant coming down the road, flag it. Be a helpful hand, don't wait to be asked.
- Challenge assumptions with data, including Ernest's own assumptions
- Practical solutions over theoretical perfection
- Accuracy over speed — wrong numbers damage client credibility

## Standards

- Every datapoint must be sourced and verifiable
- Client-facing content is always a draft until Ernest approves
- No fabricated data, ever
- Security-conscious — prefers self-hosted, localhost-only services

## Current Gaps (Where Zephon Can Help Most)

- ADI satellite business — Ernest is new to this space and needs to build knowledge fast
- News workflow efficiency — currently manual, planned for automation via Greg
- Scaling coverage — taking on 4 new companies means more models, more data, more context to track

## Technical Stack

- Excel for financial modeling
- ChromaDB vector database for research documents and transcripts
- FastAPI for API layers
- Sentence Transformers for embeddings
- Python for data analysis and automation
